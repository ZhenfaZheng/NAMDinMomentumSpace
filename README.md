# Overview

This is a program to perform non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simultion
in momentum space, where the non-adiabatic coupling (NAC) are replaced by
electron-phonon (*e-ph*) coupling (EPC).

The codes are based on [Hefei-NAMD](https://github.com/QijingZheng/Hefei-NAMD)
developed by [Qijing Zheng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zqj), et al.

# Tutorials of Runing Hefei-NAMD-EPC

## 1. Calculate *e-ph* matrix elements using PERTURBO

Befor carrying out NAMD simulations in momentum space, the user needs to
calculate *e-ph* matrix elements $g\_{mn\nu}(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{q})$ using a
modified version PERTURBO. Therefore, first of all, the user needs to install
and learn using PERTURBO. We recommend users to visit the home page of PERTURBO
([https://perturbo-code.github.io](https://perturbo-code.github.io)) to get the
source code and tutorials of PERTURBO.

Then, replace the source file "calc\_ephmat.f90" in path of "pert-src/" with
our modified file in the path of "patch" before compiling PERTURBO. It should
be noted that this patch is modified by Prof. Jin-Jian Zhou and us together,
and it will output files containing *e-ph* information (named
"\${prefix}\_ephmat\_p1.h5", "\${prefix}\_ephmat\_p2.h5",
"\${prefix}\_ephmat\_p3.h5", ...) additionally when run "perturbo.x" with
"calc\_mode = 'ephmat'".

To run perturbo.x for doing e-ph coupling calculations in ultra-fine
$\mathbf{k}$- and $\mathbf{q}$-points grids, one needs to prepare input file
"pert.in", $\mathbf{k}$- and $\mathbf{q}$-point list files "eph.kpt", and
"eph.qpt", and "\${prefix}\_epr.h5" file from qe2pert calculation.

The input file "pert.in" can be set as follows
```
&perturbo
  prefix = 'graphene'
  calc_mode = 'ephmat'
  fklist = 'eph.kpt'
  fqlist = 'eph.qpt'

  band_min = 1
  band_max = 2

  phfreq_cutoff = 0.625    ! meV

  output_yaml = .False.
 /
```

We provide a python script "kqgen.py" to generate $\mathbf{k}$- and
$\mathbf{q}$-point list files. User needs to set nkx, nky and nkz in the first
few lines of "kqgen.py" script. Then excute
```
$ python kqgen.py
```
If there are too many $\mathbf{k}$- and $\mathbf{q}$-points (nks * nqs > $10^7$),
the script will separate the $\mathbf{k}$-points into several parts and save
"eph.kpt" and "eph.qpt" files in differen folders ("1P", "2P", ...). Then user
needs to link "pert.in" and "\${prefix}\_epr.h5" file into folders for
different parts of $\mathbf{k}$-points to do perturbo calculations respectively.
```
$ for ip in *P
$ do
$     cd ${ip}
$     cp ../pert.in .
$     ln -sf ../../qe2pert/prefix_epr.h5 .
$     cd ..
$ done
```
We provide a Sbatch script "sub\_pert\_part" for users to run perturbo
calculations for different parts of $\mathbf{k}$-points.


## 2. Prepare input files

To run Hefei-NAMD-EPC, the user should prepare 3 kinds of files:
"\${prefix}\_ephmat\_p\${ipart}.h5" files containing *e-ph* information from
perturbo calculations, "inp" file for input parameters setting, and "INICON"
file for initial conditions setting.

First, copy or link "\${prefix}\_ephmat\_p\${ipart}.h5" files from perturbo
calculations by perturbo.x, user can excute bash script "lnh5.sh" to link these
files into a folder.

Then generate "inp" file, below is an example
```
&NAMDPARA
  BMIN       = 1       ! minimum band index
  BMAX       = 2       ! maximum band index
  KMIN       = 1       ! minimum $\mathbf{k}$-point index
  KMAX       = 40      ! maximum $\mathbf{k}$-point index
  EMIN       = -4.6    ! minimum energy, in unit of eV
  EMAX       = -1.5    ! maximum energy, in unit of eV
  NBANDS     = 2       ! number of bands
  NKPOINTS   = 81      ! number of $\mathbf{k}$-points
  NINIBS     = 1       ! number of initial states
  Np         = 81      ! number of unit cells corresponding to the $\mathbf{k}$-grid

  NSW        = 1200    ! number of time steps for the MD trajctory
  POTIM      = 1.0     ! time step for the MD trajctory, in unit of fs
  TEMP       = 300     ! MD temperature

  NSAMPLE    = 6       ! number of samples with different initial conditions
  NAMDTIME   = 1000    ! time of NAMD, in unit of fs
  NELM       = 1000    ! number of steps of electron wave propagation each POTIM
  NTRAJ      = 10000   ! number of surface hopping trajectories for each sample
  LHOLE      = .F.     ! hole or electron surface hopping
  LCPEXT     = .F.     ! whether to read TXT files or not (not available for epc version)

  LEPC       = .T.     ! whether to use e-p matrix as NA couplings
  LBASSEL    = .F.     ! whether to read BASSEL file. If not, will generate it. 
                       ! if ture, will ignore parameters: BMIN, BMAX, KMIN, KMAX, EMIN, EMAX.
  LSORT      = .T.     ! whether ot sort states in order of energy
  SIGMA      = 0.025   ! energy broadening
  EPCTYPE    = 1       ! 1: calculate EPC from average phonon populations.
                       ! 2: calculate EPC by norm mode decompositon form MD traj
  NPARTS     = 1       ! number of parts of ephmat information
  EPMDIR     = 'h5files/'    ! directory of ephmat.h5 files
  EPMPREF    = 'graphene'    ! prefix of ephmat.h5 files
/
```

The last file we need is "INICON" file, for example
```
   11     4     2
   23    10     1
   47    17     2
   51    21     2
   85    34     2
   93    38     2
```
Each line of "INICON" represents initial condition of each sample, the first
column indicates initial time, the second and third column indicate
$\mathbf{k}$ and band indices of initial electronic state. We provide a python
script "gen\_inicon.py" to help user generate "INICON" file, user has to set the
energy and $\mathbf{k}$-point location for initial states at the first few line in
"gen\_inicon.py" script.


## 3. Run Hefei-NAMD-EPC

Copy executable file "namd-epc" to your work diretory, then execute
```
$ mpirun -np 16 ./namd-epc # Here, 16 is the number of processes as an example
```
User can also use Sbatch script "sub\_namd" to submit the computational job.
